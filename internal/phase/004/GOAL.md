# Phase 4 — the binary's name stops choosing what it does

`parse_command_name()` reads `argv[0]` and picks a mode from it: a leading `r`
is restricted mode, `e` selects evim, `g` the GUI, and `view`, `diff` and `ex`
prefixes each change it again. **That is a Unix *installation* convention** —
symlink `rvim`, `view` and `ex` at one binary and let the name decide — and an
embedded editor, which is one file that was never installed, has no use for it.

It is also the trap this repository has paid for more than once. A reference
binary saved as `ref` runs restricted, where every shell-out fails. Renaming the
product to `slim-vim` needed a side-by-side check before it could be trusted.
And every harness here stages the binary under test as `vim` for no reason
except this function. Removing it removes the whole class.

**Nothing is lost, and that is checked rather than asserted.** Every mode the
name could select has an option that selects it explicitly, and
`tools/noargv0.py` refuses to run unless all of them are still there:

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-Z` restricted | `-R` readonly | `-y` evim |
| `-e` Ex mode | `-E` improved Ex | |

`diff` is not among them because it never selected a mode here: this build has
no diff feature, and the name only ever printed that and exited. `-d`, which
looks like its option, was an argument that went nowhere, and Phase 3 dropped
it.

**Corrected:** an earlier draft of this section claimed `view` set
`'undolevels'` to 10000 where `-R` did not. It is wrong. `p_uc = 10000` appears
at both sites in `slim-vim.c` — once in the `view` branch and once in the `-R`
case — so the two are exactly equivalent and the removal loses nothing at all.
The claim was written from the name-parsing code without checking the option
beside it, which is the mistake this document warns about everywhere else.

**The delta: none.** The harnesses stage the binary as `vim`, which selected
plain vim mode before and selects it now, so nothing they record can move. The
evidence is the score — and the fact that `whim-vim` can now be called anything
at all.
