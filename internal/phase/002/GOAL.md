# Phase 2 — the options for features that are not here

*Formerly phase 2. The other phase numbers in this file are the old numbering,
as it was written: `doc/PHASES.md` maps them.*

**It runs the front's second part first** (`front2`: D6-D8, `nolocale` to
`whim61`, and its closure; `internal/phase/001/GOAL.md` describes them), then
the query this phase was.

**There are no commands to cut, and checking that first is the point.** All
fourteen `:menu` commands and all eight `:spell` ones are *already* `ex_ni`:
upstream's `tiny` configuration never compiled them, and the slim pipeline's
empty-object prune removed their sources. A phase that repointed them would be
busywork dressed as progress, and this one asserts the fact rather than assuming
it — if a handler ever comes back, it fails and says so.

What survived those features is their **settings**. Six spell options and one
menu option are still in the table, still settable, still listed by `:set all`,
and read by nothing whatsoever. That is the same lie `:help` told: a control the
editor offers and cannot honour. So `'spell'`, `'spellcapcheck'`,
`'spellfile'`, `'spelllang'`, `'spelloptions'`, `'spellsuggest'` and
`'menuitems'` go, along with their entries in `modeline_whitelist[]`, which
would otherwise outlive the options they name.

**`'mousemodel'` is deliberately kept**, and it is the interesting one. It looks
like a menu option and is not: `:behave` sets it, and it selects how a mouse
click behaves in a terminal — which this build still does.

**The delta is cumulative and does not grow here.** `:set spell` becomes E518
and `:set all` stops listing seven options, but the Ex sweep exercises commands
rather than settings, so it records nothing new. The evidence that this phase
did something is the score, not the delta — which is the honest way round, and
better than inventing a delta to point at.
