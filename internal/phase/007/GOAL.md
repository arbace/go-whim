# Phase 7 — the editor stops looking for files it was not given

Two removals that are the same thing seen from two sides: the editor asking the
filesystem what is around the file it was handed.

## Wildcards, the rest of the way

Phase 6 removed the expander that wrote shell scripts. This removes the
editor's own. `gen_expand_wildcards()` walked directories with `opendir` and
`readdir` to match `*`, `?`, `[...]`, `~` and `$VAR`, and now hands every
pattern back unchanged — which is not a stub written for the occasion but the
path vim already took for a pattern with no wildcard in it, `save_patterns()`,
`backslash_halve()` included.

**This costs something real and the cost was measured before it was chosen.**
`:e *.c` opens one buffer named `*.c`, and **file-name completion stops
working**: `:e ali<Tab>` used to produce `alias.c` by globbing `ali*` and now
produces `ali\*`. A shell expands `*.c` before vim ever sees it, which is the
argument for this living outside; inside the editor it is 1,025 lines.

## The current directory

`:cd`, `:chdir`, `:lcd`, `:lchdir`, `:tcd`, `:tchdir` and `:pwd` are retired to
`ex_ni`. A process with a notion of "where I am" that the user can move is a
process with a filesystem; an embedded editor handed a buffer has neither.

## Two things this does not do, both of which look as though it should

**`opendir` and `readdir` do not go with the globbing.** They are held by the
**temp directory** — `vim_opentempdir()`, and `delete_recursive()` via
`readdir_core()` — which exists so `:%!sort` has somewhere to put a file.
`vim_tempname()` has exactly two callers, `do_filter()` and `get_cmd_output()`,
both of them shell users, so the directory layer dies with shell-out in Phase
8 and not with globbing here. That was measured rather than reasoned about,
after reasoning about it gave the wrong answer twice.

**`getcwd` does not go either.** It is `mch_dirname()`, and `:cd`/`:pwd` are two
of its eleven callers; the rest are `buf_modname`, `mch_FullName`,
`shorten_fnames`, `modify_fname` and the file finder, all of them resolving a
path the user named. Retiring the commands does not touch it.

## The delta

`:e *.c` names a file literally, file-name completion stops completing, and
seven command names report "not implemented" instead of changing or printing a
working directory.

**And `:recover` moves, which this phase did not predict.** The check caught it,
not the author: `recover_names()` finds swap files by building the patterns
`*.sw?`, `.*.sw?` and `.sw?` and expanding them, so an editor that does not
expand patterns cannot find a swap file whose name it was not given. That is a
consequence of removing globbing rather than a bug in it, so it is declared —
the alternative, widening the list until it fits, is how a delta list stops
being a check. It also says something about Phase 10: the swap file is already
half unreachable.

Cumulatively: `helpclose intro version cd chdir lcd lchdir tcd tchdir pwd
recover`.
