# Phase 9 — the editor stops asking the environment what language it is in

`setlocale(LC_ALL, "")` reads `$LANG`, `$LC_ALL` and `$LC_CTYPE` at startup and
changes how this process compares strings, classifies characters and formats a
time. `:language` lets the user change it again. `enc_locale()` derives
`'encoding'` from `nl_langinfo(CODESET)`. All of it is the editor taking
instruction from whatever environment it happened to be started in.

## One edit here is not a removal, and the phase is wrong without it

**`'encoding'` compiles in as `latin1`.** It is only ever `utf-8` because
`set_init_default_encoding()` asks the locale at startup and overwrites the
default with the answer. Remove that call on its own and this silently becomes
a latin1 editor — every multibyte motion, every `:s` over non-ASCII, every file
read — and it would pass the build, the linkage check and the symbol check
without complaint. So `'encoding'` defaults to `utf-8` in the same edit that
removes the derivation, and the phase **checks the running binary's
`'encoding'`** rather than trusting that it did.

That is not a behaviour change on this target, and that was measured rather than
assumed: musl answers UTF-8 to `nl_langinfo(CODESET)` unconditionally, so the
derived value was already `utf-8` — with `$LANG` set, and with `$LANG` unset.
The change makes the encoding **a property of the build instead of a property of
the machine**, which is the whole point, and it is what Phase 10 builds on.

**And `set_init_default_encoding()` is replaced, not deleted**, which took three
tries to get right. It did three things: ask the locale, re-initialise the
multibyte layer for whatever it answered, and write that back as the option's
default. Only the first is locale. The second is load-bearing and invisible:
`p_enc` is set from the option table, and **nothing acts on it until `mb_init()`
runs**. Delete the call outright and `:set encoding?` says `utf-8` while
`enc_utf8` is still FALSE — the editor claims UTF-8 and behaves like latin1,
which is worse than either. The build is clean, the symbol check passes, and
`:set encoding?` gives the right answer, so nothing above the harness can see
it. Five multibyte behaviour cases could: `à é î` stopped upper-casing. The call
becomes `(void)mb_init();`.

Two smaller traps in the same phase, both of a kind this file already records.
`mb_init()`'s `if (enc_dbcs)` block needed **brace matching, not a regex** — a
lazy `(?:[^\n]*\n)*?\}` stops at the first line that is only a brace, which here
is an inner `if`'s, leaving `vim_free(p);` and a stray `}` at file scope, which
gcc reports four hundred lines away as *"data definition has no type or storage
class"*. And `vimconv` **stays**: `mb_init()` tests `vimconv.vc_type` again two
hundred lines below the block, and removing the declaration on the strength of
one visible use is a compile error a long way from the edit.

The phase itself had a third fault worth fixing rather than noting: **an error
is not a warning.** The warning sweep counted lines matching `warning:`, found
none in a run that had failed outright, and `set -e` on the next plain compile
ended the phase with no output at all. It now asks gcc whether it succeeded
before asking what it complained about.

## The four `lang*` options

`'langmap'`, `'langmenu'`, `'langnoremap'` and `'langremap'` are all wired to
`(char_u *)NULL` — they accept a value and store it nowhere. They are Phase 3's
rule arriving late rather than a new decision, and no behaviour can change.

## The delta

`:language` reports that it is not available. Nothing else: the process runs in
the C locale now, which is what it was already running in for every purpose this
build has. `setlocale`, `nl_langinfo` and `strcoll` leave the symbol table.
